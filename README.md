# nodejs-photo-generator
NodeJS Telegram Bot, which helps me to be more productive with my telegram channel handling.

I have a telegram channel[RU] (see bio) and this bot helps me to make pictures for post more faster and easy. Before i wrote this bot, i made each picture via photoshop. And bot in this case - the most comfortable way to optimize this doing and do it faster.

I guessed to use python and imgkit for this, but nodejs seems to be easier for me, because i have more experience in nodejs and javascript, than python.

So, this bot can generate images like this:
